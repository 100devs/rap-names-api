## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node

I built out a simple HTML and CSS frontend with information on how to access the API. Then I built a server to serve all of the static files like CSS and JavaScript files. I tested the API with Postman. The API serves JSON data to the frontend, and then it is displayed on the DOM.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to host an app on heroku through the heroku CLI, as well as trouble shoot any errors with the build and test the app with Postman. I learned how to dynamically change the port for my server with an environment variables or the hardcoded port if it doesn't exist. I learned how to serve static fiies on a node server when the browser makes an HTTP request for them.

## Optimizations

I will be adding more rappers soon!

How It's Made: 
<br>
Tech used: HTML, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express
<br>
This API is used to retrieve information about your favorite rapper. This API will return the birth name, birth location, and age of the rapper. Express is used to build this API quickly
To use this API, fork this repo and clone the repo to your machine. 
Download the node modules using npm init in the terminal. 
You must be in the folder using your terminal, so make sure to cd into this repo on your local machine. 
Run the server locally using the terminal with the command node server.js.
You now have access to the data via your browser using localhost:8000/API/rapper-name. 
Replace rapper-name with the rapper of your choice.
If the rapper's name is not in the API, it will return unknown data. 


Optimizations
<br>
We could include more details about the rapper or include more rappers in general with more time. It would also be nice to include an image or video file that one can use through this API.

Lessons Learned:
<br>
Express made it easier to set up this API. Express allowed us to listen to a port to run our server on so we can test. We can also use .get() to send files or JSON.

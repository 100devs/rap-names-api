## Notes for Cloning Project

Be sure to install Express by following the commands in the terminal:

**cd rap-names-api** 

*(make sure you are inside of the rap-names-api folder)*

**npm init**

*(hit enter to accept)*

**npm install express --save**




## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, GitHub, Heroku

<!-- Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold. -->

## Optimizations

With more time, we could build out the API with more rap names.

We could also use this API structure to create our own API.

## Lessons Learned:

We learned how to create an API with Node and Express. How to check the API via Postman (https://www.postman.com)

For client side code, the API will be fetched and will make a request to our server that was made. The CORS package needed to be installed and implemented in the code.

*How to install CORS*

In the terminal:

**npm install cors --save**

## Examples to use in the API:

**21 Savage**

**Chance the Rapper**
